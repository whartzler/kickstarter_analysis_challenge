# kickstarter_analysis_challenge

## Overview of Project
Louise our partner wants to know how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch dates and their fundraising goals. 

### Purpose
Our purpose was to analyze different categories and subcategories to review different outcomes to understand the results. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Our two analyses for this project were to analyze Theater Outcomes by Launch data & Outcomes Based on Goals. No challenges were faced but when referencing another tab always make sure you’re referencing the correct column and making the formulas within the spreadsheet correctly show the information we were trying to display. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We analyzed outcomes based on Launch Date for all years and countries included our dataset.  Based on the graph below we can see the graph has a symmetric distribution with most the successful months for a theater to launch their Kickstarter being in May, Jun, July.  This resulted in an average of 99 campaigns being successful during these months.  

The failure rate is like the successful rate and follows the line almost parallel but the three most failed months to launch a campaign being May, July, and October. During these 3 months the average number of failed campaigns is 51.

After conducting this analysis, we can conclude the best period to start a Kickstarter campaign is during the summer starting in May through August, as based on our data you have a statistically higher chance to run a successful campaign.  



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Through analyzing the outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns based on their goal we identified the lower goal you ask for the higher rate of success you must run a successful campaign, but when a campaign has a goal of $35k to $45k we see a spike to a 67% success rate!

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The Challenges and Difficulties encountered were minor but as stated make sure your formulas are correct and referencing the correct data.  

## Results

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Through these two data sets some limitations about the conclusions made is we didn’t have any major identifiers on why outcomes were successful, what details made specific Kickstarter more successful than others and visa versa what details made some fail.  This would allow us to use additional metrics and information to give to Louise to assist her in running a successful campaign.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other tables and graphs we could include are comparing the most successful/failed categories and subcategories.  Comparing the number of backers to the success rate of a campaign.  Most successful years of each category. These are a couple of additional tables/graphs we could create to explore the data.
